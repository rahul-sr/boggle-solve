Boggle Board
=============

After having played a couple of games of Boggle, I found myself frustrated by my
inability to conjure up words as quickly as my competitors. Thus I decided to
build something that would solve the puzzle for me. The unfortunate side effect
is that now my friends won't play Boggle with me.

Instructions
------------
Just fill in the puzzle and then click Solve, or hit Enter. You can also feed
data using query parameters, e.g. `...?rows=4&cols=4&text=somecharactershere`.
The characters will populate the puzzle one row at a time, filling columns from
left to right.

Dictionary Size
---------------
Note that the dictionary included in the demo contains words up to length 7.
This is so the demo loads quickly.
